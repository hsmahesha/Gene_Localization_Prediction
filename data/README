The files Genes_relation.test and Interactions_relation.test
have the same format as the files Genes_relation.data and
Interactions_relation.data.  Genes_relation.data provides all
the basic information about the 381 test genes, while
Interactions_relation tells the genes (training or test) with
which each test gene interacts.  The file Full_File.test has
the same format as Full_File.data, but again is for the test
genes rather than the training genes.  Note that in both
Genes_relation.test and Full_File.test, the function and
localization fields are missing, that is, have been replaced
by question marks (?).  If you prefer a version of Full_File
containing *both* the training and test genes in one file, that
is available on request (although again the functions and
localizations for test set genes will be missing, of course).

You may submit your predictions by email to page@biostat.wisc.edu
or by anonymous ftp to ftp.biostat.wisc.edu, placing the file
into the directory dropboxes/page/.  You may choose to submit
predictions for one or both of Task 2 and Task 3.  Task 2 is to
predict function, while Task 3 is to predict localization.  Please
read the following carefully before submitting.


TASK 2

If using email, please use the subject line "KDDcup <name> function"
where <name> is your name.  If using ftp, please name the file
KDDcup.<name>.function where <name> is your name.  For example,
my submission would be named KDDcup.DavidPage.function

Your submission should be in the form of a file that starts with
your contact information, followed by a line with 5 asterisks,
followed immediately by your predictions, one per line.  Because
each gene may have more than one function, you might have more than
one line per gene.  Each line should have the form

<gene name>,'<function>'

where you are predicting that the gene named <gene name> has the
function <function>.  Hence, after your contact information, the
prediction file will have the form:

*****
G234062,'CELLULAR ORGANIZATION (proteins are localized to the corresponding organelle)'
G234062,'TRANSCRIPTION'
G234081,'CELLULAR TRANSPORT AND TRANSPORT MECHANISMS'
G234081,'"Auxotrophies, carbon and"'
G234081,'ENERGY'

etc.


Because our scoring is automated, please ensure that gene names
and functions are exactly as they appear in the training (.data) and
.names files we provided earlier. 


TASK 3

If using email, please use the subject line "KDDcup <name> localization"
where <name> is your name.  If using ftp, please name the file
KDDcup.<name>.localization where <name> is your name.  For example,
my submission would be named KDDcup.DavidPage.localization

Your submission should be in the form of a file that starts with
your contact information, followed by a line with 5 asterisks,
followed immediately by your predictions, one per line.  Each line
should have the form

<gene name>,'<localization>'

where you are predicting that the gene named <gene name> has the
localization <localization>.  Please note that, unlike function,
you may assume each one has a unique localization.  Hence, after
your contact information, the prediction file will have the form:

*****
G234062,'cytoplasm'
G234081,'nucleus'

etc.

Again, because our scoring is automated, please ensure that gene
names and localizations are exactly as they appear in the training
(.data) and .names files we provided earlier. 

FINAL NOTES

Only one submission per person per task is permitted.  If you do not
receive email confirmation of your submission within 24 hours, please
email page@biostat.wisc.edu with subject "KDDcup no confirmation".

For group entries, the contact information should include the names
of everyone to be credited as a member of the group should your entry
achieve the highest score.  But no person is to be listed on more than
one entry per task.
